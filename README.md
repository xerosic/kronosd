# kronosd
Kronos was born by my frustration with using the crontab syntax and to make a better configuration system JSON will be used.

# Goals

The project aims to be:
 - Easier to configure than crontab
 - Lightweight to make it a viable choice even on low power devices
 - Secure, thanks to Rust memory safety
 - Easy to use on many platforms
